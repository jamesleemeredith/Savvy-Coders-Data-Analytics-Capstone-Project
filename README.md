# Savvy Coders Data Analytics Capstone Project

Welcome to my repo! This repo contains a Data Analytics Project from the Savvy Coders Data Analytics + Python bootcamp. The purpose of the project was to test which chord progressions make up a majority of today's popular songs in order to answer the essential question "What makes a hit song anyway?". The project utilized webscrapping techniques to scrape song and artist information from a music database (HookTheory), and then used that information to pull a song's popularity data from the Spotify API. All collected data was then stored in a SQL database before final visualization in Tableau.
